Template for Requirements Management using Needs
=================================================

This template is demonstrator for using Needs as a requirements management
tool with some basic Sphinx docs. Furthermore this documentation is published
on https://readthedocs.io

The documentation built for this archive can be found here: https://req-mgmt.readthedocs.io.
And also here in GitHub Pages: https://qluit.github.io/req-mgmt/.
Documentation is also built as PDF upon every pull request in the GitHub action.

If you want to build this documentation yourself, you can clone the archive and build it.
You need to run the tests in 'software/bmi' before the documentation can be built.
The manual on how to build the documentation can be found in the 'docs/source/usage.rst' file.

The repository also contains example code for a BMI calculator in Java and C++.
Both examples have a readme on how to run the tests and generate the test report.
